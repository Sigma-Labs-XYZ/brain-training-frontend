## Objective

The goal of this website was always fun! Players around the world should simply be able to have fun with eachother whilst sharpening their minds by completing quick fire maths questions. 
 <br/><br/>

Our first plan for the project was to make a game that would be a battle royale concept where players would be eliminated round by round.
However after some planning, as a group, we realised that our ambitions for the game were too big for the timeframe we had. <br />
We then made a decision to slightly alter the concept so that the players in the multiplayer game could still compete with eachother however there would be no battle royale, just a simple point system on which the winner would be decided. <br/>

This project was built with the Javascript coding language, using MaterialUI and some plain JSX to help flesh out the front end,
and using Socket.io to pass data between users' frontends for low-latency multiplayer gameplay.<br/>

The core features for the are:

- Registering a Player's account
- Logging into your Player account
- See a Leaderboard for all of the top scores
- View a set of rules just incase you arent aware of how to play
- Be able to view companies
- Customise your profile with a win message
- Customise your profile with our very own avatars
- Be able to chat to other players live
- Most importantly play the game in both singleplayer and multiplayer modes!
